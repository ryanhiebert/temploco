This repository is a place for me to do some experiments with
different approaches to composing sites, primarily in Django.
I'm basing this work off of the project in the Hypermedia
Systems Book https://hypermedia.systems/book/.
I am finding things that don't feel quite right, and want to
take their good ideas to the next level of clarity
and consistency with the web platform.

One aim is that the patterns could be progressively enhanced to
the greatest degree possible. This probably requires some additional
server-side abstractions, but if those are easy and composable enough
I think that we can get a long way without having to cause our site
not to work when javascript is not available. This is not because
working while Javascript is not available is critical, but because
it enables more people to use this work without compromise.
